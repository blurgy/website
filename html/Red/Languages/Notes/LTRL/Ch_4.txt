3. Do you have gold, Sextus? They have much gold. Many of them have gold. Give his/her/its
 gold to me.
 4. You with your allies to I will order to conquer the hostile men of the province. Why are you making delay? 
 5. You indeed conduct a good life without cares, my Lucius. <i>I</i> am always distressed about money.
 6. Come on, <i>speak<i>, my son. Do you not here the happy words of the master? He is saying nothing of bad. The master indeed has hatred of you.
 12. Says the queen, "O sailors (for friends you are to the Roman people), go without delay out from the province and (what's more) set sail into the deep sea! Be moved by the great danger of war!"
 13. The free man is telling his opinion (speaking a sentence) about the advice of the Gracchi. For free men are able to tell their thoughts without care and not fear the ill-will of the people.
 16. The great poet sings of the deeds of the gods and (what's more) the men and women are listening. Even the deeds of the you sing of with glory, out poet; indeed by the gods you will be moved.
 25. Perceive the jealousy of Julia, o girls, but praise her wisdom. Nothing bad indeed can be said about the daughter of the queen.
 26. You were making delay for the slaves in the field. They were not even able to work.

 47~. I for my part neither desire nor am able to conduct life without a plan.

 51. With many words indeed I will plead the case for my friends in the forum, and I will overcome the feelings (conquer the opinions) of many. I will not even fear the ill-will of the people.
 52. Why is war and whats more arms by you being pondered? Wisdom, oh allies, you ought to desire. For it is a gift of the gods.
 53. Many of us perceive the hatred of the queen for the war, but you lead her toward our opinion. (whaaa?)
 54. Form a plan concerning this war, my son. Will auxiliary troops to our allies in the provinces be send with you? Certainly in (respect to) my opinion, our men will wage war with glory.
 55. Gaius Gracchus always good things on behalf of the people both said and did; not even by the dangers of jealousy (ill-will) was he moved.
 56. The land is seen by the happy sailors out of the deep sea. Did the gods send them through the sea to the land?
 57. The sailor out from the dep sea to Italy will come. For he is led by the good gods.
 58. Desirous of glory and what's more of gold the famous sailor entusiasticly desires to set sail, but I will give to him reasons to delay. Many indeed are the dangers in the deep sea.
 59. The man surpasses the girls in judgement. To them indeed is nothing of judgement.

 61. The poet says, "I will sing of the gods in the sky and (what's more) the famous deeds of the gods." He has beautiful judgement.
