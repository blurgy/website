1. We will lead the auxiliary troops with ourselves in order that we may drive the enemies out of the province into another place.
We were leading the auxiliary troops with ourselves in order that we might drive the enemies out of the province into other places.
2. Caeser is urging his men not to be frightened by the dark shadows.
Caeser gave an order to his men not to be frightened by the dark shadows.
3. Fortune is a blind goddess, as the ancients relate. Peace is also a goddess, for whose benefit after the serious war we created alters.
4. Do not praise everyone, friend. For there is a limit in things. Praise only he who does and speaks well.
5. Cicero, when he was speaking in the forum to the people, Antony to the same people to whom (he had praised?) Caesar with words was praising. Although he used to fear the latter man, he hates the former. Neither (of them) has he ever followed.
6. The eyes of that slave are blind and he is able to see nothing. On account of this thing let him be called "Blind."
7. The loyal man was always alone after the death of his wife whom only (his wife) he had loved; for in fact he felt no feelings of affection after those.
8. Both Caeser and Antony desire power. If only you would give it to neither man, senators. We are asking this thing on behalf of the freedom of the country.
9. In what manner would a man in respect to his eyes having been captured be able to go through the streets to the forum? Why does he dare to walk to that place alone?
10. Which of these citizens seems loyal to you? Of which of these men do you praise the words and deeds?
11. There are even under the earth secret laws of nature, which certainly the farmer perceives.
12. Always to us of the homeland liberty is not a source of small concern. Never with they who occupy the city with arms will we make peace.
13. "I shall urge the inhabitants of this land to remain steady in their friendship of the Roman people." Caeser would often say this thing to his troops.
14. From which land did you depart? What heavy dangers did you experience in order that you might come to this our city? What reason did you have for that miserable flight? What were you seeking?
15. After there was ordering that all men fight in front of the city walls, I ask you with what mind were you able to bear the fear of death? To me indeed at that time remained the same attitude: (my) zeal for war was outstanding. However, many of the soldiers were fleeing without (in the absence of?) law.
16. "You love the same woman who loves you. (Who loves you, that same woman you love.)"
"Lucky is he who is pleasing to the woman he loves (to her is pleasing whom he loves)"
"That brother is without trust, however, who loves one woman, holds another."
17. The father to his (sons) said: "Death has come to me. For strength and life are withdrawing from my body. Soon I will certainly be a shadow." His eyes after this were wandering to the sky. Peace to him with death was finally given.
18. "What was the fate in respect to these men who were ordered into the serious war by Caesar?"
"Some have been killed in battle by now, others have luckily returned home."
19. We are held between hope and fear. On account of which thing tell us: what did our king experience either of good or bad in that battle? For to us is hope of (for) the one thing, of the other fear.
20. Into the same opinion finally came those men to whom either there was serious hatred or sharp fear of that (notorious) king: we all were desiring to send him to death. Which thing however we never accomplished; and what is more we often tried.
21. I will say this with a clear voice in order that you may be able to hear me easily, o allies: Neither are we able to conquer the enemies nor is any hope being given by the good gods. On account of which thing I am commanding to you that you flee.
22. I was waiting all day at home in order that I might not be seen by the enemies. Indeed if I had been seen by them, I would have endured bad things. I was not even daring to go from home with my sword.
23. Marcus said to his brother: "Which of us will be chosen (as) consul?" You certainly please the people well, (but) I have many friends in the senate.
24. These captured slaves do not have any hope of freedom unless (except) through flight. On account of this reason let them dare to go away from this land.
25. Horace, who made beautiful poems for the people, now even later we will always praise because of this skill.
26. You passed this law in your consulship which now you yourself do not obey. You ought, in my opinion, to go into exile. If only the goods would give you that intention!
27. All your things are before your eyes and between your hands, soldiers. You cannot flee and there will not be any hope of safety unless you drive the enemies out of the country.
28. After the body of a person has been put in the earth, there is a saying: "Let the earth be light to him."
29. You will free me from great fear, Catiline, if you go into exile. On account of which thing the consul advises you to depart without delay. Let depart also from the city that band (of yours) of disloyal peopl, indeed of your allies. If only you would be obedient to the voice of the consul and the empire!
30. I was blind: I had not seen the treachery of citizens earlier. Now finally all things are clear to me and I will be obedient to only you, Antony.
31. Ten of the soldiers are being driven by the king into flight and exile because of (their) disloyal deeds. Which thing even a blind man could see.
32. We came to Rome and at the same time Caesar came with us in order that he might speak in the senate about things accomplished by means of peace and war.
33. Who ever in the lands would allow the exiles and flights of many loyal citizens? Why do good men endure these things?
34. Juppiter, listen to me yourself - if with any words you can be moved. I am loyally asking you to grant peace and take away all fears from me and my mine.
35. If the fates should call you, you will not flee from death by means of any physical strength. One man will try one thing, another man another thing. No man has ever been able.
36. That brave consul, who had been ordered to go into exile, obeyed on the same day and departed from Rome. Not, however, did any cities in Italy accept him.
37. I urge you, friend, to keep hope and faith. Help, in my opinion, will be brought by those gods to whom loyal men are dear. They will never abandon us.
38. To whom, I ask you, is that plan (of yours) about (the) war pleasing? For the wretched things of war have often been placed before the eyes of all. Never do men desire to fight for the liberty of others.
39. How are the father and master different? The latter is obeyed because of fear, the former becuase of love. My master however left behind for (the advantage of) me all of these things that I have.
40. Unless the citizens obey that law about violence, there will be fighting in the streets and many will die. I have never seen a war between the citizens, never desire to see (one).
41. Catullus is considered one of the new poets because he dared to make his poems in a new way and not as before.
42. Great at this time were the accomplishemnts not only of the soldiers but also of the citizens. (One and the same?) they gave themselves to study and art: with deceptive words they carried out a plot in order that they might entirely conquer the enemies.
43. The courage of one man was a source of help and (what's more) safety to the Roman citizens. From (for) which reason the city was freed from fear. All men indeed were happy, I before all; for my that man was my son.
44. After Caesar came into the province, some states desired to obey the empire of the Roman people, others had taken up arms and (what's more) were seeking war. An when these things were understood by all, there was great fear of Caesar.
45. In the forum to my citizens I said the same thing that (I am saying) to you in the senate: "If you send troops to the province with Caesar, you will stir up enmity and hatred among the people of the whole province. How will you be able to endure the resentment of of (our) allies also?"
46. I, although I used to love you and was pleasing to you, was nevertheless blind in spirit. I for my part am certainly the same man who I always was. Thus I ask you, do you hate me now? You seem to me a fickle and deceptive girl.
47. I said these things deeply and well. Now hear of a few things from me: "Let us not fight for a great war with the enemies. But let us send through the battle line at night only this soldier in order that he may kill their king with (his) sword. In which manner certainly the enemies will fight among themselves."
48. Will you permit that man to go into exile who was stirring up a revolution among the citizens, who was attempting to kill the consul, who was conducting himself entirely in order to win the empire for (the benefit of) himself?
49. The mind often errs: but my eyes have seen this: our men, although on this day there was feirce fighting, were in no way able to be conquered by the enemies.
50. I for my part will send certain men through the countryside; I will give an order to them that they (I will order them to) search for the disolyal citizens and bring them to Rome.
51. Trivial to the citizens this danger of war, to the consul alone serious did it seem. Therefore he advised the soldiers not to set aside their arms.
52. Let us urge these slaves not to obey any of their masters. What slave has not ever desired to be freed?
53. Why would Caesar have stirred up war in the province if a great part of the citizens had been desiring peace?
54. After the whole republic at last moved into the judgement of a few men, there was not even the appearance of freedom in the senate. For the fathers gave (their) trust to one man, to one man were obedient.
