	<h1>Verbs</h1>

	<h2>Latin</h2>

	<p>
		Every Latin <b style="font-size: larger;">verb</b> has a
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>person</b> (first, second, or third),
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>number</b> (singular or plural),
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>tense</b> (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, future perfect),
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>voice</b> (active or passive), and
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>mood</b> (Indicative, Imperative, or Subjunctive)
			</li>
		</ul>
		The <b>person</b> denotes the relation of the speaker to the subject - whether the speaker is discussing himself, the listener, or a third subject. The <b>number</b> denotes the quantity of the subject. The <b>tense</b> is determined by the combination of 1. The <i>time</i> at which the action occurs with respect to the time of the speaker (present, past, or future), and 2. The relation of the action to the passage of time (simple, progressive, repeated, or completed) (also called the <i>aspect</i> of the verb). All Latin noun tenses that express progressive aspect may also express repeated aspect. The <b>voice</b> denotes whether the verb's subject is performing or receiving the action of the verb. The <b>mood</b> denotes the speaker's attitude toward the factuality or likelihood of the verb's action.
	</p>

	<h3>The Indicative Mood</h3>

	<p>
		The indicative mood is used to represent something as factual, or to ask a question of fact. There are six tenses of the indicative mood:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Present</b> - Action in <i>present</i> time, with <i>simple</i> or <i>progressive/repeated</i> aspect. (She thinks. She is thinking. She thinks [every day / often / repeatedly].)
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Imperfect</b> - Action in <i>past</i> time, with <i>progressive/repeated</i> aspect. (She was thinking. She used to think. She thought [every day / often / repeatedly].)
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Future</b> - Action in <i>future</i> time, with <i>simple</i> or <i>progressive/repeated</i> aspect. (She will think. She will be thinking. She will think [every day / often / repeatedly].)
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Perfect</b> - 1. Action in <i>present</i> time, with <i>completed</i> aspect. (She has thought.) or 2. Action in <i>past</i> time, with <i>simple</i> aspect. (She thought.)
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Pluperfect</b> - Action in <i>past</i> time, with <i>completed</i> aspect. (She had thought.)
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Future Perfect</b> - Action in <i>future</i> time, with <i>completed</i> aspect. (She will have thought.)
			</li>
		</ul>
