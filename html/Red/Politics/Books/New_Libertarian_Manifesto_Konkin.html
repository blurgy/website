<h1><i>New Libertarian Manifesto</i> - Samuel Edward Konkin III</h1>

<h2>Statism: Our Condition</h2>
	
	<p><b>Coercion</b> is immoral, inefficent, and unnecessary. Diffuse coercion is optimally handled by local, immediate self-defense, though the market may develop larger-scale businesses for protection and restoration. <b>Organized coercion</b> requires organized opposition. <b>Institutional coercion</b>, developed over millennia with roots in mysticism and delusion planted deep in the victims' thinking, requires nothing short of <b>Revolution</b>. <b>The State</b> is this institution, and it is the enemy of <b>Libertarianism</b>.</p>

	<p>
		The Libertarian philosophy is elaborated from a single premise: initiatory violence or its threat (coercion) is immoral and forbidden; nothing else is. <b>The Market</b> is the sum of all voluntary human action. If one acts noncoercively, one is part of the Market. There are many paths to liberty. Once these paths are discovered, they demand individual action in order to achieve a free society. This manifesto calls for that action.
