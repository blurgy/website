<h1><i>Anarchism</i> - George Woodcock</h1>

<h2>Early Anarchists</h2>
<p>
  Certain attiudes lie at the core of what we may call anarchism: faith in the decency of of man, desire for individual freedom, and intolerance of domination.
  These attitudes have always been present in Human society, and have taken different forms at different times.
  But anarchism as a developed, identifiable, and articulate trend only recently emerged in the modern era of conscious social and political revolutions, after the <b> collapse of the medieval order</b>.
  This collapse led on one side to <b>nationalism</b> and the modern centralized state, and on the other to <b>the revoluionary trend</b>, which itself split into <b>authoritarian (Marxist)</b> and <b>libertarian (Anarchist)</b> currents.
</p>
<p>
  The dissolution of medieval society took on ecclesiastical, social, and political forms, and retained this triple aspect until the end of the seventeenth century.
  The criticisms of society in this period were voiced by <b>fundamentalist religious dissenters</b>.
  Prior to these criticisms, peasants who revolted in the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries had contented themselves with reformist demands, retaining their faith in certain aspects of feudalism.
  The medieval tendency was to see Man as a member of a community ordained by God, and while these revolts emphasized equality, they contained no aspect of individual liberty, instead retaining an expectation of conformity to the community.
  This individualist trend was only to emerge during the early renaissance with its secular exaltation of the self-fulfilled humanist scholar, and the later stages of the reformation, with its personalistic view of religion, rejecting organized forms.
</p>
<p>
  These secular and religious trends propelled the seventeenth century toward a deepening consciousness of the value of individual liberty, and during the English Civil War this consciousness produced the earliest recognizably anarchist movements among the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers">Levellers</a></b> and the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggers">Diggers</a></b>.
  The Levellers were from the lower ranks of the New Model Army, and wanted their share in governing the country they had fought to liberate from the Divine Right Kings. Their demand was for universal sufferage.
  The Diggers were poor men, victims of the economic recession that followed the war. Their demands were not political, like those of the Levellers, but social and economic.
</p>
<p>
  The leaders of the Diggers' protest of 1648-50 were <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrard_Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a></b> and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Everard_(Digger)">William Everard</a></b>.
  Winstanley's pamphlet <b><i>Truth Lifting Up Its Head Above Scandals</i></b>, established that the movement was based on the principle of reason, and declared that if Man were to align his conduct with reason, he would naturally fulfill his social duties.
  In his pamphlet <b><i>The New Law of Righteousness</i></b>, he equates Christ with universal liberty and criticizes all forms of authority.
  He also attacks property rights, by which economic and political power are exercised against the universal liberty of the people.
  And he condemns punishment and contends that crime arises from economic inequality.
  Winstanley's utopia is one in which work is done in common and all its products shared equally, with no rulers, and men living peacefully with each other according to the promptings of their own consciences (which, ideally, are guided by reason); commerce is abolished and in its place a system of open storehouses develops.
</p>
<p>
  The Diggers' practical attempts at realizing their philosophy by seizing commons and waste lands (which covered approximately two-thirds of England at that time) and working them communally were short-lived. Their numbers were too small and they were too much of a threat to the authorities, who persecuted them relentlessly.

<h2>Godwin</h2>
<p>
  <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Godwin">William Godwin</a></b> was a libertarian thinker who preceded the anarchist movement of the nineteenth century.
  He saw society as a naturally developing phenomenon which can operate in complete freedom from government, but he did not share the faith of his anarchist successors in the spontaneous instincts of the untutored people; in his view, <b>education</b> was the key to universal liberation, and he feared that without it, men's "ungoverned passions will often not stop at equality but incite them to grasp at power."
</p>
<p>
  In 1793 he published <b><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enquiry_Concerning_Political_Justice">An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</a></i></b>, in which he put forward his own conception of a simplified and decentralized society with a minimum of authority, arrived at by means of propaganda divorced from political motives.
  In an earlier prospectus published in 1784, <b><i>An Account of the Seminary</i></b>, he states that the existence of the government depends upon the opinion of the governed, and that government is very limited in its power to make men virtuous and happy, in contrast wth education, which endows us with our moral disposition and character.
  Godwin believed that human character is determined by environment rather than heredity, and that peoples' vices arise from the defects of education.
  He viewed the infant as a kind of <i>tabula rasa</i> on which experience writes its story.
</p>
<p>
  In <i>Political Justice</i>, Godwin argues from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessitarianism">Necessitarian</a> viewpoint; he sees <b>Necessity</b> as the immutable and impersonal moving force of the universe which expresses itself through natural laws and determines the actions of human beings.
  Man moves through his life on a pre-determined path, but his actions affect the course of this path, and these actions may be either voluntary or involuntary.
  He sees a Man's <b>involuntary actions</b> as dictated by past experience, while his <b>voluntary actions</b> as determined by judgement.
</p>
<p>
  He begins with four basic propositions: 
  <ol>
    <li>The moral characters of men are determined by their environments, so that the elimination of harmful external factors, and the education of rational judgement to inform their voluntary actions, can eliminate their criminal tendencies.</li>
    <li>Government has the most power out of any existing institution to operate upon people's minds, due to its sheer extent. </li>
    <li>Government is bad in theory and practice. It gives substance and permanence to our errors through legislation. The laws it enacts give power and privilege to select wealthy individuals, promoting economic inequality.</li>
    <li>The political and intellectual state of Man is on a course of progressive improvement.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Godwin believes that an inner change in the <b>moral judgement</b> of the individual will take him to the condition of <b>natural justice</b> from which his subjection to political institutions has diverted him.
  The authority of government cannot persuade an individual to develop his reason. Nor can political associations, which seek to persuade by numbers rather than truth. But the formation of loose <b>discussion groups</b> might lead naturally to a universal movement that could effect this change.
</p>

<h2>Stirner</h2>
<p>
  In his single important work, <b><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ego_and_Its_Own">The Ego and His Own</a></i></b>, the German philosopher <b><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Stirner">Max Stirner</a></i></b> proceeds from Hegelianism to its almost complete inversion in a doctrine that denies all absolutes and all institutions, basing itself solely on the "ownness" of the human individual. He denies all natural laws and common humanity, and sets forth as his ideal the <b>egoist</b>, the man who realizes himself in conflict with the collectivity and with other individuals, and who, having proclaimed his <b>ownness</b> in the war of each against all, may then enter into a "<b>union of egoists</b>," without rules or regulations, for matters of common convenience.
</p>
<p>
  Stirner set out to demolish not merely all religious beliefs, but also every political or social or philosophical doctrine that seemed to him, by posing anything outside the individual, whether an absolute principle, a party, or even a collective abstraction like Man, to start the religious process all over again. In contrast to Godwin's stress on reason, he speaks for the will and the <b>instincts</b>, and seeks to cut through all the artificial constructions of human thought, to the elemental self. The human <b>individual</b> is the only thing of which we have certain knowledge, and each individual is unique. It is this uniqueness that every man must cultivate; the ego is the only law, and no obligations exist to any code, creed, or conception outside it.
</p>
<p>
  Freedom, in Stirner's view, is surpassed by uniqueness or "ownness." As he puts it, "I am free from what I am rid of, owner of what I have in my power or what I control. My own I am at all times and under all circumstances, if I know how to possess myself and do not throw myself away on others. To be free is something that I cannot truly will, because I cannot make it, cannot create it; I can only wish it and aspire towards it, for it remains an ideal, a spook." Yet in his fight for ownness, Stirner finds himself faced with the same enemy as the anarchist in his fight for freedom - the state. The state is the negation of individual will. It is based on the worship of collective man. And, as Godwin noticed, its systems of legislation result in a freezing of action and opinion. The man who wishes to possess himself in uniqueness cannot tolerate these limits upon his behavior.
</p>
<p>
  In the vacuum left by the annihilated state, a world of egoists would arise, characterized by <b>might</b> instead of <b>right</b>. The egoist does not demand any rights, or recognize any rights of others. What the egoist can get by force, he gets. He has no right to what he cannot get by force. (Note: This is logically consistent. If rights do not exist, and F stands for 'get by force', while R stands for 'has a right to', then A => !R is always true, so !F => !R, just as F => !R.) In Stirner's world of egoists, however, each man will have withdrawn into his own uniqueness and will recognize that to rule over others by force would destroy his own independence, as it implies the substitution of his subjects' power for his own - they create him, and so he is not his own. (Note: I don't fully understand this argument.)
</p>
<p>
  In opposition to society, Sterner proposes unions of egoists. In his view, the society consumes the individual - it lays claim to him for itself and exists without him. But the individual consumes the union - it exists for him and through him, and he abandons it when it serves him no further purpose. A kind of equilibrium based on mutual respect and the danger of mutual destruction would arise between individuals and between unions. To achieve this world of egoists, Stirner advocates individual <b>rebellion</b> in opposition to organized <b>revolution</b>. Revolution is to him a political or social act, aimed at arranging people differently through new institutions. Rebellion is, by contrast, the refusal of individuals to be arranged - through rebellion, individuals elevate themselves above the established order, rather than overthrowing and replacing it.
