<h1><i>The Enchiridion</i> - Epictetus</h1>

<h3>I</h3>

	<p>
	  There are things within our power, and things outside our power. Our opinion is within our power, but our fortune is not. If a Man grasps for things beyond his proscribed fortune, he will operate beyond his power and be disturbed. But if he contents himself with his own fortune, he will suffer no harm. And by these means, he may acquire happiness and freedom.
	</p>

<h3>II</h3>
	
	<p>
		If a man limits his desire to things which are within his power to obtain, he will not be disappointed. Likewise if he only feels aversion toward those things which are within his power to avoid.
