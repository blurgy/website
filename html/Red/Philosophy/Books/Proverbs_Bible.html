<h1><i>Proverbs</i> - The Bible</h1>

<h3>I</h3>

	<p>
	  These are the Proverbs of Solomon, the purpose of which is to confer wisdom. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Do not lie in wait for blood with sinners, who greedily prey upon the innocent, for they lie in wait for their <i>own</i> blood. The Lord's wisdom is crying for the simple, scornful, and foolish to follow her, but they have refused, for they did not fear the Lord; thus the Lord will mock them in times of distress. But whoever listens shall dwell safely, free from fear of evil.
	</p>

<h3>II</h3>
	
	<p>
		Whoever inclines his ear to wisdom shall understand the fear of the Lord, and will discover the Lord's knowledge. He will learn, among many other good things, the righteousness, judgement, and equity of the Lord. And thus he will remain on the Earth, while the wicked will be rooted out.
	</p>

<h3>III</h3>

	<p>
		Whoever possesses mercy and truth will find favor among God and men. Trust in the Lord's understanding and not your own. In all your deeds, acknowledge him, and he will direct you. Thank him for your fortune, and it will grow. Do not despise his chastening, for he corrects those he loves. Wisdom is more precious than material things, for it confers wealth and honor and a long, pleasant, and peaceful life. It was through His wisdom that the Lord created the universe. Do not neglect to do good unto others when it is within your power, and do not do evil unto others when they have done you no harm. Do not envy your oppressor, nor seek to emulate his ways. The lord will curse the wicked, but bless the just; he will scorn the scorners, but give grace unto the lowly; the wise shall inherit glory while the foolish inherit shame.
	</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

	<p>
		So said King David to Solomon, his son: Get wisdom, and use this wisdom to get understanding. This will bring you honor, grace, and glory. If you are wise, the Lord will not need to correct you - you will not be hindered in your path. The wicked will be hindered and will not know why. You must not walk in the path of the wicked. Be diligent about your ways.
	</p>

<h3>V</h3>

	<p>
		Use discretion: a 'strange woman' may persuade you with her sweet talk, but she will lead you to a bitter end. If you follow her, you will spend years of your life giving your honor, wealth, and labor to cruel strangers.
