<h1><i>Proverbs</i> - The Bible</h1>

<h3>I</h3>

	<p>
	  These are the Proverbs of Solomon, the purpose of which is to confer wisdom. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Do not lie in wait for blood with sinners, who greedily prey upon the innocent, for they lie in wait for their <i>own</i> blood. The Lord's wisdom is crying for the simple, scornful, and foolish to follow her, but they have refused, for they did not fear the Lord; thus the Lord will mock them in times of distress. But whoever listens shall dwell safely, free from fear of evil.
	</p>

<h3>II</h3>
	
	<p>
		Whoever inclines his ear to wisdom shall understand the fear of the Lord, and will discover the Lord's knowledge. He will learn, among many other good things, the righteousness, judgement, and equity of the Lord. And thus he will remain on the Earth, while the wicked will be rooted out.
	</p>

<h3>III</h3>

	<p>
		Whoever possesses mercy and truth will find favor among God and men. Trust in the Lord's understanding and not your own. In all your deeds, acknowledge him, and he will direct you. Thank him for your fortune, and it will grow. Do not despise his chastening, for he corrects those he loves. Wisdom is more precious than material things, for it confers wealth and honor and a long, pleasant, and peaceful life. It was through His wisdom that the Lord created the universe. Do not neglect to do good unto others when it is within your power, and do not do evil unto others when they have done you no harm. Do not envy your oppressor, nor seek to emulate his ways. The lord will curse the wicked, but bless the just; he will scorn the scorners, but give grace unto the lowly; the wise shall inherit glory while the foolish inherit shame.
	</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

	<p>
		So said King David to Solomon, his son: Get wisdom, and use this wisdom to get understanding. This will bring you honor, grace, and glory. If you are wise, the Lord will not need to correct you - you will not be hindered in your path. The wicked will be hindered and will not know why. You must not walk in the path of the wicked. Be diligent about your ways.
	</p>

<h3>V</h3>

	<p>
		Use discretion: a 'strange woman' may persuade you with her sweet talk, but she will lead you to a bitter end. If you follow her, you will spend years of your life giving your honor, wealth, and labor to cruel strangers.
	</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

	<p>
		If you enter into an agreement with someone, or owe them a debt, go to this person humbly when you are called, and free yourself at once from their control. Do not rest until the deed is done. Do not become slothful, or povery and desperation will overtake you. The wicked, who sow discord, will be overtaken suddenly by disaster and will never recover. The lord hates seven things: an arrogant look, a lying tongue, hands the shed innocent blood, a heart that crafts evil plans, feet that run swiftly into mischief, a false witness that speaks lies, and he who sows discord among his fellows. This wisdom will lead you when you travel, protect you when you sleep, and commune with you while you are awake. The commandment is a lamp; and the law is light. Do not lust after strange women, or commit adultery. The affronted spouse will show no mercy in his vengeance - no repayment will be enough, and you will be greatly dishonored and shamed.
	</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

	<p>
		Internalize this wisdom. Carry it with you wherever you go. Do not be seduced by the strange woman who lies wait around every corner, or commit adultery. Her ways lead to hell and death.
	</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

	<p>
		Listen to wisdom, who calls to you at every fork in the road. Her knowledge is more precious than the treasures of the world; seek it, not wealth. To fear the Lord is to hate evil, pride, arrogance, and wicked speech. Through the Lord's knowledge, one may acquired wealth, honor, and power. The Lord rewards those who love him. The Lord teaches the way of righteousness and judgement. The Lord possessed wisdom before he created the world, and he used it to make the world. Do not refuse the Lord's instruction. For those who follow his wisdom will obtain his favor. Those who sin against him wrong their own soul; they who hate him love death.
